The project aims to create an innovative real-time sign language translation system
by leveraging advanced deep learning and computer vision techniques. This system is
designed to capture sign language gestures through a live camera feed, process them
using sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and provide immediate text or audio
translations. By doing so, the technology seeks to bridge the communication gap between individuals who rely on sign language for communication and those who are not
familiar with it, fostering inclusivity and accessibility in various social and professional
contexts.
The core of the system lies in its ability to interpret sign language gestures accurately
and efficiently in real-time. Using computer vision techniques, the camera captures
the gestures made by the user. These gestures are then processed by deep learning
models trained on extensive datasets of sign language gestures. Techniques such as
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are
utilized to recognize both static and dynamic gestures, as many sign languages involve
intricate movements that span over time. The system can also incorporate Transfer
Learning to enhance accuracy by utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for
sign language recognition.
The application potential of this system is vast. In educational settings, it can empower students with hearing impairments by providing instant translations during lectures. In workplaces, it can facilitate smoother communication between colleagues, fostering inclusivity. Healthcare providers can use the system to communicate effectively
with patients who rely on sign language, ensuring better medical care. Additionally, the
system can be implemented in public spaces, customer service centers, and emergency
response scenarios to bridge communication gaps swiftly
